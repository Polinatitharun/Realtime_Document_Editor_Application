Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor
This project is a real-time collaborative document editor built using React.js, Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and Quill. It allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously, with real-time synchronization of content and user presence tracking.

Project Overview
This application is designed to provide users with a seamless experience when collaborating on documents in real time. By using WebSockets (via Socket.IO), it ensures that any content changes made by one user are instantly reflected on all other connected users' devices.

The backend is built using Node.js and Express to handle real-time communication, while the frontend is built using React.js, with Quill as the rich text editor.

Features
Real-Time Collaboration: Multiple users can edit the same document at the same time, with live updates pushed to all users.
User Presence: Displays the list of users currently in the document, allowing real-time collaboration transparency.
Version History: Users can view and revert to previous versions of the document.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Proper CORS configuration ensures that the frontend React app (running on a different port) can interact with the backend.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout to support different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, Quill (for the text editor), Socket.IO-client
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
Database: In-memory version tracking (for simplicity, could be expanded to NoSQL for persistence in future)
Authentication (Optional): Can be integrated with JWT for secure user identification
Deployment Tools: Docker, Heroku, AWS (for cloud deployment)
Getting Started
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
Basic knowledge of React and Node.js.
Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Polinatitharun/Realtime_Document_Editor_Application.git
cd document-collaboration-app
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Backend (Node.js/Express/Socket.IO)
Navigate to the backend folder and install the necessary dependencies:


cd backend
npm install
Frontend (React.js)
Navigate to the frontend folder and install the necessary dependencies:

cd frontend
npm install
Step 3: Create Environment Variables
In the root of the project, create a .env file and add the following configuration:

Backend .env file:
env
PORT=3000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3001
Frontend .env file:
env

REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000
Step 4: Run the Application
Start Backend
bash

cd backend
npm start
This will start the backend server on http://localhost:3000.

Start Frontend
bash
cd frontend
npm start
This will start the frontend React app on http://localhost:3001.

You should now be able to open your browser and visit http://localhost:3001 to access the collaborative document editor.

Effective Solutions Implemented
1. Real-Time Collaboration with Socket.IO:
We used Socket.IO to create a bidirectional event-based communication channel between the client and the server. This ensures that updates to the document are transmitted instantly to all connected users.

2. User Presence Tracking:
We implemented a user presence feature that updates the user list in real-time whenever someone joins or leaves the document. This is powered by emitting and receiving events (joinDocument, updateUsers) over Socket.IO.

3. Version History:
Version history is tracked in-memory, allowing users to view and revert to previous versions of the document. This feature uses a combination of state management in React and event handling in Socket.IO.

4. Responsive Design:
The frontend layout is fully responsive, using CSS media queries to adjust the editor and sidebar UI components based on screen size. This ensures the application is usable on both large desktops and small mobile devices.

5. CORS Configuration:
Proper CORS headers were set up to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend running on a different port (3001) while the backend listens on port 3000. This setup enables seamless communication between the two.

Deployment
For deployment, you can use services like Heroku, AWS EC2, or Docker to host both the backend and frontend.

Deployment Steps
Frontend Deployment:

Build the React app for production:
bash
Copy code
npm run build
Serve the build folder using Express (for backend deployment).
Deploy the app to services like Netlify or Vercel for frontend-only hosting.
Backend Deployment:

Ensure the backend is serving static files correctly for production:
javascript
Copy code
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build')));
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html'));
});
Deploy the backend to services like Heroku, AWS EC2, or DigitalOcean.
Socket.IO & CORS Configuration for Production:

Ensure that your Socket.IO server is configured to accept connections only from trusted origins by properly setting the origin in the cors configuration.
Future Practices
Persistence: Implement database integration (like MongoDB or Firebase) to persist document content and version history, ensuring data is stored beyond just the session.

Authentication & Authorization: Add user authentication (via JWT or OAuth) to ensure users are identified when editing the document, making it secure and personalized.

Real-Time Collaboration Features:

Add features like change tracking to show exactly what content is being modified in real-time.
Integrate more advanced conflict resolution mechanisms when multiple users are editing the same content.
Testing & Optimization: Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and scalability of the application.

Scaling: Consider implementing WebSockets clustering or use a message broker (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub) to handle multiple servers and scaling needs as user load increases.
